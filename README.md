The library of logic contains a set of example problems that can be 
used to train LLMs to think logically

Each example in the library is a simple problem/game that is
easy for a human or a computer algorithm to solve, but hard for
LLMs (currently) to solve

Some examples include, [Sudoku](https://manifold.markets/Mira/will-a-prompt-that-enables-gpt4-to)
and [tic tac toe](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11v3rqw/gpt_is_really_good_at_tic_tac_toe/)



Each example in the library of logic contains 3 things:
1) A short description describing the format of the problem and the rules
2) A computer program that taking a input in the correct format can  
 a) compute the "next step"
 b) or produce an error if an invalid step has been taken
 c) optionally an explanation of why that step was taken (or invalid)
3) some example problems, or a problem generation program

The goal of this library is ultimately to be able to produce a dataset of the following form:

```
User
Please solve this problem:
{ rules and format}
{example problem}
Assistant: 
Certainly, I will work step-by-step.  Here is first step:
{output of the first step of the computer program}
User:
Good, keep going
Assistant:
Here is the next step
{output of the next step of the computer program}
...
```
